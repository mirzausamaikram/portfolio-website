# Usama Ikram's Portfolio Website

### Welcome to my digital home!

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. Built from the ground up, this site is a showcase of my skills, projects, and professional journey. It's designed to be professional and direct, with a touch of personalityâ€”all without any headache-inducing animations.

### **Features**

* **Clean and Professional Design:** A high-contrast, easy-to-read layout that keeps the focus on the content.
* **Fully Responsive:** The site looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A simple, sticky header with smooth-scrolling links for a seamless user experience.
* **Dynamic Project Showcase:** A grid layout to highlight my projects with images, descriptions, and direct links to live demos and code.
* **Personal Storytelling:** An "About Me" section that goes beyond a standard bio to tell a compelling story about my journey and skills.
* **Future-Focused:** A dedicated section to highlight new technologies and skills I am actively learning.

### **Technologies Used**

* **HTML5:** For the website's clean and semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including a custom color palette, responsive design, and subtle hover effects.
* **JavaScript:** For minor interactive elements like smooth scrolling and the sticky navigation bar.
* **PHP:** A simple back-end script to handle the contact form submissions.
