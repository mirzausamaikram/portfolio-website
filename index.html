        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've worn many hats—from logistics to event supervision—and my experiences have given me a unique perspective on problem-solving. A prime example was during a high-stakes FIFA match, where an unexpectedly large and impassioned crowd began to breach security. As a supervisor, I took immediate action by coordinating with other supervisors and marshals to form a human wall, successfully containing the situation and preventing any harm. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication, leadership, and staying calm under pressure—skills I now apply to debugging complex code and working within a development team. I am a team leader, a fast learner, and I don't panic quickly, which makes me a reliable team player.</p>
