        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've worn many hats—from logistics to event supervision—and my experiences have given me a unique perspective on problem-solving. A prime example was during a high-stakes FIFA match, where an unexpectedly large and impassioned crowd began to breach security. As a supervisor, I took immediate action by coordinating with other supervisors and marshals to form a human wall, successfully containing the situation and preventing any harm. This experience taught me the importance of clear communication, leadership, and staying calm under pressure—skills I now apply to debugging complex code and working within a development team. I am a team leader, a fast learner, and I don't panic quickly, which makes me a reliable team player.</p>

                <p>Tackled two classic AI problems using Python in Jupyter Notebook. For **route finding**, I implemented **UCS and A* algorithms** with heuristics to find optimal paths. For **map coloring**, I formulated it as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using the **python-constraint library**. This project deepened my understanding of search algorithms, heuristic design, and constraint propagation—showing how AI techniques elegantly solve real-world geographic challenges. Hands-on experience with these core AI principles sparked genuine enthusiasm for computational problem-solving.</p>

                <h3>Smile & Sunshine Toy Sale System – E-Commerce Platform</h3>
                <p>A fully responsive, client-side e-commerce platform for custom toy purchasing, developed individually within a group project context for the Higher Diploma EA module at HKIIT. The platform delivers an intuitive, delightful shopping experience centered on user needs and HCI best practices.

The system features a **dynamic toy customization interface** where users select colors, sizes, and accessories with real-time preview updates powered by jQuery DOM manipulation. Customers can seamlessly **add toys to cart**, review order history, and submit purchase requests through an intuitive checkout flow. A **quotation system** allows personalized pricing requests, while a dedicated **sales personnel view** displays pending orders and quotes for order management.

Built entirely with **HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery** on the front-end, the platform leverages **localStorage for persistent session management and order history**, eliminating the need for backend infrastructure while maintaining full functionality. Responsive design principles ensure flawless experience across devices. Comprehensive form validation and user feedback messages guide customers seamlessly, while thoughtful navigation architecture minimizes cognitive load—key to an inviting toy-shopping interface.

This project demonstrates my ability to architect feature-rich, user-centric web applications using pure front-end technologies, balancing technical implementation with delightful user experience design.</p>

                <h3>Musical Ensemble Management System (MEMS) – OOP & Design Patterns</h3>
                <p>A comprehensive console-based application demonstrating advanced design pattern implementation and object-oriented principles in Java. MEMS enables users to create and manage two ensemble types (Orchestra and Jazz Band), each with role-specific musicians, while supporting full undo/redo functionality across all operations.

The system leverages the **Abstract Factory pattern** to encapsulate ensemble and role creation, allowing seamless extension for new ensemble types. The **Command pattern** forms the architectural backbone—every operation (create, add, modify, delete, rename) is encapsulated as a Command object, enabling clean separation of concerns and straightforward operation history management. The **Memento pattern** is integrated within command objects to capture and restore ensemble state, preserving names and musician roles during undo/redo operations. The **Invoker class** maintains separate stacks for undo and redo commands, orchestrating execution and rollback seamlessly.

This pattern composition demonstrates how well-designed architecture enables powerful features without code duplication. Built with pure Java using OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism) and leveraging Vector collections for type-safe storage.</p>
